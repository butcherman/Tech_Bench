# Chapter 3 - Administration

The standard Administration link is for administrators who are in charge of maintining users and customers, but should not be able to make global site changes.  Administrators are broken into four categories.

Notifications and Alerts
------------------------
Alert or notification messages can be placed globally on all users Dashboard's, or individually to specific users.  The System Alerts are a global alert that stay in place until the expiration date, and User Alerts are assigned to either one specific user or a group of users.

User alerts also have an expiration date, but they also have the ability (if allowed) to be dismissed by the user so that they do not continue to show each time the user visits the Dashboard.

User Administration
-------------------
Administrators can controll all user settings for each registered user within the system.

### Reset User Password
This will reset a users forgotten password and allow the Administrator to force the user to change the password once they log back in with the new password.

### Change User Settings
This will allow Administrators the ability to view any users current settings and modify them if necessary.

### Add New User
This will allow Administrators to create new users for fresh access to the application.

### Deactivate User
In the case a user should no longer be allowed into the application, deactivating a user will immediately stop them from being able to gain access.  All of their files, info, and contributions to the application will remain in tact, but the user will not have any access to them.

*Note:* Users are not deleted from the Administration menu.  This is to ensure that all contributions that they have made to the application are left in tact with reference to the individual who made the contribution.

File Link Administration
------------------------
Users commonly forget to delete file links they have created and the links along with their files can grow large in size over time.  This section allows Administrators the ability to both view and modify all file links in the system.

### View Expired Links
This will list all links that are currently in the system, but are no longer active since their expiration date has passed.  These links can be viewed, or deleted as necessry.

### View Active Links
This will list all links that are currently valid and active.  These links can also be viewed or deleted as necessary.

Customer Administration
-----------------------
Basic customer information can be modified on an Administrator level that should not be modified by individual users.

### Change Customer ID Number
If the wrong customer ID number was entered, or the number needs to be modified for any purpose, it can be adjusted in this section.

### Deactivate a Customer
If access to a customer needs to be removed, but the files and information needs to remain in tact, the customer can be deactivated so that users can no longer access their information.  All files and information will remain in the database, but will not be accessable by users.

###  Reactivate a Customer
When a deactivated customer needs to be accessable again, they can easily and quickly be brought back online.

### Delete a Customer
This will remove all files and information for the customer.  *Please note* this action cannot be undone as it will immediately remove all of the information for that customer.  If you are not sure if the information will be needed in the future, it is better to deactivate the customer instead.
