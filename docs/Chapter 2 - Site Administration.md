# Chapter 2 - Site Administration

Withing the site administration, a system administrator can set the types of systems that your company work on as well as application maintenance and application settings.  Site Administration is broken into three categories.

Categories and Systems
----------------------
Every system that is added to the Tech Bench must be placed within a category.  Examples of Categories:
* CCTV
* Network Equipment
* Security Systems

Categories can also be used to identify specific manufacturers instead if necessary.  For an example with Network Equipment:
* Cisco
* AdTran
* Dell

When creating a new category, the category will be added to the Navigation menu, and a folder will be created within the folder structure for this category.

Within each category, a specific system can be created for that category.  Within these systems manuals, notes, and software can be stored.  These systems can also be assigned to customers and specific information for that system can be gathered for that customer.

When a new system is created, select the Category that the system should be under, and then enter the system name.  

In the "Customer Information to Gather" section, enter any information that is specific to that system and customer.  Examples:
* IP Address
* Login Username
* Login Password
* Version

Note:  All customer system information gathered is encrypted in the database.  This is the place to store any sensitive information.  Customer notes and files are not encrypted.

After a system is creaed, it too will be added to the Navigation menu under the parent category.

System Maintenance
------------------

System Maintenance consists of two sections:

### Maintenance Mode
This will shut down the site so that no one can log in or make changes.  Files cannot be uploaded at this time, and only System Administrators can access the site.  This is used to temporarily shut down the system for creating backups, or updating the system.

### View Logs
There are several logs that are gathered for troubleshooting help and system maintenance.  The View Logs section will list all logs and allow System Administrators to view the logs live as the system is being used, or download the log for later review.  Logs can be downloaded individually, or all at once in a zip file.
Log files can also be archived and cleared for a fresh start to help with system monitoring.

Global Settings
---------------

Global Settings are system wide settings that will affect all users.

### System Settings
System Settings allow System Administrators to activate and deactivate optional features.  These features are:
* File Links
* Company Forms
* My Files
For more information on these sections, see the *Additional Options Sections* of Chapter 1.

### Email Settings
The email settings are setup during the site configuration, but if they need to be modified after the site is operationa, this section will allow System Administrators to update those settings.

Just as in the Site Setup sections, you can use the "Test Connectin" button to send a test email and confirm that your settings are correct before saving them.
