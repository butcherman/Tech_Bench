Welcome to Tech Bench's documentation!
======================================

Tech Bench is a custom built Content Management System (CMS) designed with the field service technician in mind.  As field techs travel from site to site,
they need to be able to quickly access information about their customers, the equpiment each customer has, as well as a Knowledge Base of tips and tricks to
help make their job as efficient as possible.

The Tech Bench consists of two major sections:
------------------------------------------------

Customer Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users can create customer accounts and store customer specific information for each of these customers such as: the type of equipment they have, login and other
specific information for that equipment, notes for the site, and files speific to that customer.  This central storage location ensures that all registered users
have access to the same information.

Additional features for ustomers include the ability to create a custom link that will allow files to be accessed by visitors or allow visitors to upload their own files.
Other add on modules can be added to expand the Tech Bench's functionality.

Tech Tips
^^^^^^^^^
It is important for field technicians to have centralized access to the latest manuals and software for the equipment that they work on.  It is also importatnt to be able
to share new tips and tricks when a tech finds an easier way to complete a task, or comes across an application or problem that needs to be shared with their fellow techs.
The Tech Tips section provides that centralized access that allows techs to collaborate and share information that can be easily searched for at a later date.

Any time a new Tech Tip is created, an email is sent to all registerd users with the basic Tech Tip information, and a link to view the Tech Tip in it entirety along with any
attached files.

Additional features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Additonal features include the ability for users to create a custom file link that allows outside users/customers to upload or download files that may be to large to email directly.
Each file link has a unique hash and expires after a given date so that the information is no longer accessable.

The Tech Bench can also be easily expanded via Add-On modules for a more custom experience to fit your technicians needs.
