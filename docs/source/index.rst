Welcome to Tech Bench's documentation!
======================================

Tech Bench is a custom Content Management System (CMS) built to aid service technicians by allowing them to store and share information for the systems and customers they maintain.

The Tech Bench consists of three major sections:
------------------------------------------------

System Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users can store files for individual system types such as:  documentation, firmware, and helpful notes.  This information can be accessed by any registered user.  This gives your company a central location to store this information rather than relying on needing access to several different manufacturers web sites.

Customer Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users can create customer accounts and store customer specific information for each of these customers such as: the type of system they have, login information for that system, notes, and files speific to that customer.  This central storage location ensures that all registered users have access to the same information.

Additional features for ustomers include the ability to create a custom link that will allow files to be accessed by visitors or allow visitors to upload their own files.

Tech Tips
^^^^^^^^^
While working in the field, all service technicians run across tips and tricks that they use to make their jobs easier.  The Tech Tips section allows for registered users to share these tips with all other users.  This creates a custom Knowledge Base for registered users.
