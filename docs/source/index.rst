Welcome to Tech Bench's documentation!
======================================

Tech Bench is a custom Content Management System (CMS) built to aid service technicians by allowing them to store and share information about their customers and equipment they install and maintain.

The Tech Bench consists of two major sections
---------------------------------------------

Customer Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users can create customer accounts and store customer specific information for each of these customers such as:

* The type of equipment they have installed
* Login papsswords and other information for the equipment
* Notes and files speific to that customer and their equipment.

This central storage location ensures that all field staff have access to the same information.

Additional features for customers include the ability to create a custom link that will allow files to be accessed by guests or allow guests to upload their own files.  These links are temporary links that are only available for a configurable amount of time

Tech Tips and Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While working in the field, all service technicians run across tips and tricks that they use to make their jobs easier.  The Tech Tips section allows for registered users to share these tips with all other users.  This creates a custom Knowledge Base for registered users.

The Knowledge Base can also include official documentation for the different equiopment that your company installs and maintains.

Whenever a new Tech Tip is created, an email is sent to all registered users notifying them of the tip.
