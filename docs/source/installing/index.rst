Installing the Tech Bench
=========================

The Tech Bench is designed to run on a dedicated server.  The `Tech Bench Installer<https://github.com/butcherman/Tech_Bench_Installer>_` repository on Git Hub
holds installation scripts that will aid with setting up the Tech Bench in a smooth manner.  If you use one of the scripts, all that is required ahead of time
is to install the Operating System and make sure it is up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

Select your server environment for instructions.

It is the responsibility of the system administrator to install and maintain the operating system and web server with the latest updates and security patches.
