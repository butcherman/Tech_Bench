Tech Tips
=========

It is important for field technicians to have centralized access to the latest manuals and software for the equipment
that they work on.  It is also importatnt to be able to share new tips and tricks when a tech finds an easier way to
complete a task, or comes across an application or problem that needs to be shared with their fellow techs.  The Tech
Tips section provides that centralized access that allows techs to collaborate and share information that can be easily
ched for at a later date.

Any time a new Tech Tip is created, an email is sent to all registerd users with the basic Tech Tip information, and a
link to view the Tech Tip in it entirety along with any attached files.
