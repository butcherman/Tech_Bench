    <div class="text-center">
        <h5>View Log File</h5>
        <p>
            View each entry of the selected log file. If additional information
            is provided, an icon will show on the right side of the log entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: Log entries are stored in UTC Timezone, but modified here to
            show in the Applications Timezone. Due to this, one full day will
            have entries in two different log files.
