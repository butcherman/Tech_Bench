## About Tech Bench

Tech Bench is a custom Content Management System (CMS) designed specifically for service technicians working in the field.
This application allows technicians to securely store and share important customer information such as contact names, equipment
installed, equipment backups, and notes about the customer. The advantage to using this application is to allow any technician

-   even those unfamiliar with the customer - quick and centralized access to all of this information.

## Tech Bench consists of two major sections

### Customers

Customer accounts can be created as stand alone or with multiple attached sites. Customer specific information can then
be stored and shared for quick centralized access. Information includes:

-   Equipment Types Installed
-   Equipment Specific Information (such as IP Addresses, login information, etc.)
-   Contacts, including onsite and offsite contacts
-   Notes for the customer, their specific site, or specific to the installed equipment
-   Files such as backups, site maps, etc.
